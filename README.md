# About 
This is an experimental tool that I created for personal purpose in my projects on [hinecsoft.com](hinecsoft.com).

This is my first open source project, I apologize for the newbie stuff. This is an opportunity to continue learning.

# Technology Involved
Codepoems is built using [io.js](https://iojs.org), [nwjs](http://nwjs.io/) and the processing-java CLI.

# Building
You need to have [node-webkit-builder](https://github.com/mllrsohn/node-webkit-builder) in order to run these commands. The node-webkit-builder creates a builder folder with the packages.

#### Building for OSX64
```
git clone https://github.com/necsoft/codepoems
npm install
bower install
npm run build_osx64
```
